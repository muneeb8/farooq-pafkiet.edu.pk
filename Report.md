##Project Description##

Our group applied  the concept of RSA Cryptography in our Discrete Math project.This program will take string input from the user and  encrypt this string and decrypt this string back in the end of running Program.Our group use Euler's Theorem in our Project.

##Discrete Maths Concepts Used in Project##

We used Euler's Theorem.In this we first find large prime numbers that is p and q and from that value of  p and q we will find totient which is represent by small (n) from that we get public and private keys.

##Problems Faced##

We only face problem  to implement in programming language and the equations that implement in our project.We solved this problems with help of youtube and take help of freinds.
